# StorageCube
A Dropbox clone for learning JUnit

## How to use
1. Import the project using Maven
2. Pass in directory file
3. Add files to to that directory

## Limitations
1. In order to delete a directory you must delete all the items in the directory
2. You cannot add a directory with files; the files will be ignored. First, create a directory. Then add the desired files
